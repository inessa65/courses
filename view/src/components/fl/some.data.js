Add as much sugar syrup as you like,    starting with a small amount – you can always stir more in at the end if you’d like it sweeter.      Blend until foamy and the ice is broken into slush.      Pour into a glass and add a scoop of ice cream or some whipped cream, if you like.",

      "description": "Make around 35ml espresso using your coffee machine and pour into the base of your cup.       Steam the milk with the steamer attachment so that it has around 1-2cm of foam on top. Hold the jug so that the spout is about 3-4cm above the cup and pour the milk in steadily. As the volume within the cup increases, bring the jug as close to the surface of the drink as possible whilst aiming to pour into the centre. Once the milk jug is almost touching the surface of the coffee, tile the jug to speed up the rate of pour. As you accelerate, the milk will hit the back of the cup and start naturally folding in on itself to create a pattern on the topnp",
